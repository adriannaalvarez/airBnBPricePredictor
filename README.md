# Airbnb Price Prediction with Random Forest

This project involves building a Random Forest model to predict Airbnb prices using a real-world dataset. The model aims to analyze various factors influencing Airbnb pricing and provide accurate predictions to help hosts optimize their listing prices.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** To develop a machine learning model that predicts the prices of Airbnb listings based on multiple features.
- **Model:** Random Forest
- **Problem Type:** Supervised Learning, Regression
- **Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a real-world Airbnb dataset that includes various features such as location, number of rooms, amenities, and other relevant details. The target variable is the price of the Airbnb listing.

## Problem Statement

This project addresses a supervised learning problem where the goal is to predict a continuous value (Airbnb price) based on input features. Given that we aim to predict a specific numerical value for each listing, this is classified as a regression problem.

## Model Purpose

The Random Forest model built in this project can help Airbnb hosts determine optimal listing prices by considering various factors like location, seasonality, and property characteristics. By leveraging this approach, hosts can maximize occupancy rates and increase revenue.
